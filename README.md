<h1 align="center">Game - Newbie PM Growing Story </h1>

## Preface
As a newbie programmer who just started coding for 2 weeks, I  mode this game!


## Self-introduction
### Background
- Name: Ming-Ren Chen (Ben Chen)
- Education: National Taiwan University (None CS related!)
- Work Experience: Production plan、Business planning、Product management in Foxconn, LG Chem,Garmin (None IT related!)

### Programming Experience
- Full-time: 2 weeks 
- Part-time: Online courses like Hahow、Alpha Camp (None efficient learning, though)


## Framework of The Game
### Idea
- Create a game consisted of 3 roles, 3 days, encounting 3 incidents with 3 endings
- The ending would be determined by the choices user made, as the score/weighting would be different.
     - There are 3 indexes to for score calculation: 
          - Power
          - Ability
          - Reputation
     - The weighting would also be different according to the role user selects.
     - The higher the score is, the better the ending will be.
     - E.g. If user chooses male as his role, the weighting of reputation would be 0.9. In day 1, if user choose visit all, the reputation would be 0.9*60= 54; so that the user's reputation score would be 0+54=54.
     
### Actual Work
- Being MVP with 1 role, 1 main incident, 1 random case with 1 ending
